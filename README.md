# Docker and ROS Learning Repository

Welcome to our team's Docker and ROS learning repository. This repository is a place for us to learn, share, and document our discoveries about Docker, Docker image creation, and ROS (Robot Operating System).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Docker: [Installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- ROS: [Installation guide](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
- ROS 2: [Installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)

## Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

### Docker Image Creation

Docker images are the basis of containers. An Image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.

## ROS (Robot Operating System)

ROS is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.
